========
Hello!

You are in our repository, that contains implementation of the solution for single mode generation in RCPSP problem. 
Currently we focus on evolutionary algorithm approach. Project uses EA implementation 
from [deap library](https://code.google.com/p/deap/)

Goal is to provide a simple platform which allows researchers to benchmark their solutions with baseline implementations.
This project will also contain tools (e.g. io for RCPSP problem, evolutionary operators) that allow 
users start research quickly sparing time for fine tuning of other parts of their solutions.

Before you decide to use it, please contact us first for some guidance notes how to use the project and information how to refer to our work, because 
we have submitted the paper with documentation for this project.
